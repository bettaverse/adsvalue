##### Why?

Most people believe advertising doesn't work or, at least, it doesn't work on them.

That is the genius of ads.

If we collectively acknowledged the effectivness of advertising we would ban it immediately.

##### Reclaim your attention

Maybe you're sick of being influenced by faceless executives and would prefer to influence yourself?

Now you can replace online ads with your own slogans to positively influence your behaviour.

## Overview

CatBlock(previously known as "AdBlock with CatBlock") is like an ad blocking extension, but instead of blocking ads it shows you pictures of cats by default (configurable).

You can also disable replacing ads by cats, so Ads Valuecan work as a standard ad blocking extension (useful for when you're doing presentations anywhere!)
