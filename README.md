# Ads Value
Replace online ads with slogans personalized for you

Why?

Most people believe advertising doesn't work or, at least, it doesn't work on them.

That is the genius of ads.

If we collectively acknowledged the effectivness of advertising we would ban it immediately.

Reclaim your attention
Maybe you're sick of being influenced by faceless executives and would prefer to influence yourself?

Now you can replace online ads with your own slogans to positively influence your behaviour.

## Overview

Ads Value(previously known as "AdBlock with CatBlock") is like an ad blocking extension, but instead of blocking ads it shows you pictures of cats by default (configurable).

You can also disable replacing ads by cats, so Ads Valuecan work as a standard ad blocking extension (useful for when you're doing presentations anywhere!)

If you want to find out the history of this extension, you can check it out [here](https://github.com/CatBlock/catblock/wiki/History).

## Goals

This project aims at maintaining and improving the original [CatBlock](http://ads value.getadblock.com) project by Michael Gundlach (the creator of [AdBlock](https://getadblock.com) and CatBlock), which is built on top of the AdBlock code.

AdBlock has recently switched to the Adblock Plus codebase in version 3.0, but instead of importing those changes to ads value, we think it would be better to improve the original codebase.



## Supported browsers

Ads Valueis compatible with following browsers:

- Chrome: 49+
- Opera: 35+
- Safari: 6+
- Firefox: 48+
- Edge: Windows 10 Anniversary - version 1607

## Tools we use

We use many different services to help keep Ads Valueworking! We use [Travis](http://travis-ci.org) to build new versions automatically for us.

We also have Travis connected to <a href="https://browserstack.com"><img src="https://bstacksupport.zendesk.com/attachments/token/q3lgvdc6t3gMJfqDUFkqsMgrP/?name=Logo-01.svg" alt="BrowserStack" width=70 href="https://browserstack.com"/></a>, to run a few automated unit tests for us. If "builds:passing" shows at the top of this README, then it's probably working fine, otherwise the current version of the code might not work so well.
